# chiv-admin-helper
## What it does
When you run `listplayers` in the chiv console this tool will automatically grab your clipboard contents
and scans the list of players.
This will give you a table of every connected player with their PlayFab ID, account creation date, platform, current name and known aliases.

Wanted and suspicious players are highlighted alongside a pre-written ban or kick commands that you can use to quickly take action:

Ban commands are generated by the **SAK Wanted Board**. 
The wanted board is a global and shared banlist that contains known hackers, FFAers, racists or otherwise banned players.
If you want a player on that list, open a ticket on the SAK discord server.
This way, bans are applied to every server where admins use this tool.
When a ban is not permanent, they will expire at the same time across every server.

The suspicion level of a player is calculated using a variety of metrics.
Suspicious players will be marked yellow and show both a kick and ban command.
This filter is fine-tuned by SAK to warn against potential server crashers to allow banning them before they spawn and crash the server.
False positives like innocent noobs or alt accounts are possible.

## How it works
As mentioned above, this tool continuously monitors your clipboard data.

***IMPORTANT:*** It only reads text data (not files or images) and only responds when the clipboard contains a `listplayers` output.

This behavior usually causes antivirus software to classify this program as virus,
since this could technically be used to steal passwords from your clipboard!
For this reason, it is strongly recommended to install this tool by compiling it yourself.
This is the only way to guarantee that you are running a safe and unaltered build of the program.
Further instructions are detailed in the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md).
